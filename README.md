## Overview of the template
- `index.html` is the entry point of the slideshow. It loads the markdown file, create the slideshow, and takes care of converting all `.draw` images to SVGs for your presentation.
- `style.css` is the CSS stylesheet used to style the slideshow. Add any styles you need to create the perfect presentation there. See the unofficial list of themes: https://github.com/gnab/remark/issues/522.
- `slides.md` is the content of your slides. Update this file to change the content of your slideshow. See the official markdown cheatsheet: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet.
